Customization

The `mkname` package is designed to allow you to customize the names
it generates. This is done in two main ways:

*   Customizing the `names.db` database,
*   Customizing the script configuration.


.. _db_customization:

Customizing the Names Database
==============================
The names generated by :mod:`mkname` come from data stored within a
database stored within the package. I don't recommend modifying that
database because it could cause problems with future updates to
:mod:`mkname`. However, :mod:`mkname` does have tools that allow you
to create names databases of your own to use instead of the default
one supplied with the package.

The easiest, and best documented, way to do this is to use the
`mkname_tools` script supplied with the :mod:`mkname` package. I'll
get into details about some of the things it can do below, but if
you ever want a quick overview of everything it does, you can access
its help at the command line::

    $ mkname_tools -h


.. _copy_default_db

Copying the Default Names Database
----------------------------------
The easiest way to get started making a custom `names.db` is to
create a copy of the default database supplied with the package.
Let's say you want to create a copy of the `names.db` in the
current working directory::

    $ mkname_tools copy


.. _create_empty_db
.. _add_names_to_db
